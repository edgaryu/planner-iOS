# planner-iOS

Swift productivity app designed to help users build strong routines and habits.

### Demo
<image src="planner-demo.gif" width=316 height=590/>

### Features
* Add multiple subroutines: one for when it is raining, another when you woke up late, etc.
* Weather interface that shows you the upcoming weather forecast.
* Weather suggestions. Prefer exercising when it's not raining, or when it's not too hot outside? Set your weather preferences and the app will suggest the best days to commit to your routine.

### Concept
The app builds upon the notion of the <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">cue-routine-reward cycle</a>, which states that cues in our environment trigger routines (or habits) that eventually lead to some sort of reward. However, unfortunate situations such as bad weather or feeling tired will oftentimes discourage an individual from following up with their routines. Bad weather may encourage people to put aside exercise for another day, which sets back their fitness goals whenever they face discouraging situations. Thus, it is best to have "alternative" routines that can still push you to your goal despite whatever life throws at you. Want to exercise more and had plans to go hiking but it's raining outside? Make an alternative routine for indoor exercises that will still help you progress towards your goals, even when life gets in the way.
